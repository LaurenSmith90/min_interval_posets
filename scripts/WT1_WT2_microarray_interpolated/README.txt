Data previously published in Orlando et al 2008.

Microarray data annotated using Affymetrix Yeast Genome 2.0 microarray annotation 35.

Interpolated to every 1 interger life point using Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating Polynomial (PCHIP) function in Python.

WT1 life points trimmed to completely overlap those of WT2.

Genes chosen are "core" yeast cell cycle oscillator genes.
